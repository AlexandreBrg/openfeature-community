# OpenFeature Mission and Vision

## Mission

To improve the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), no matter the size of the project, by standardizing feature flagging for developers.

## Vision

Many developers get started using feature flags by developing a simple, home-made solution. This works fine for basic use cases, but quickly becomes difficult to scale as your project grows. Wouldn't it be great if you could get started with feature flagging today, while maintaining flexibility for future requirements? That's where OpenFeature can help.

OpenFeature can achieve this vision by:

### Vendor neutrality

OpenFeature aims to be the primary mechanism an [application author][glossary-app-auth] interacts with when using feature flags in code. The lifecycle for the feature flag itself is completely decoupled, allowing [application integrators][glossary-app-int] to choose the tooling that best fits their current requirements.

### Extensible

OpenFeature should be extensible while still being easy to work with. It should be quick to get started with, while providing [application authors][glossary-app-auth] the flexibility to customize the functionality based on their business requirements and workflows.

### Community

OpenFeature is a collective effort that benefits from years of experience across multiple verticals, including many of the top feature flag vendors and practitioners. [Application authors][glossary-app-auth] can benefit from this collaboration by utilizing the specification and accompanying resources.

### Education

Feature flagging is a simple, yet powerful mechanism that improves the entire SDLC by decoupling feature release from a deployment. However, it isn't ubiquitously used throughout the industry. OpenFeature is an opportunity to promote good software practices in a vendor neutral way through feature flag evangelism.
