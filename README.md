## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-feature/projects/1).
New initiatives for the roadmap will be marked as `roadmap-proposal` by a maintainer. A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome!
Please see the contributing guidelines

### Contributing Prerequisites (CLA/DCO)

Contributor License Agreement or
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco).
By submitting pull requests submitters acknowledge they grant the [Apache License v2](./LICENSE) to the code and that they are eligible to grant this license for all commits submitted in their pull requests.

## Associated Components and Implementations

The OpenFeature specification defines abstractions and interfaces for the purposes of flexibly integrating with various feature flag management systems, as well as with tools orthogonal to feature flag evaluation (such as telemetry and logging). In order to maintain [neutrality and no/low dependencies](https://github.com/open-feature/spec#design-principles), implementations of these abstractions should not be included in SDKs. Such implementations may exist in the "contribs" repository for their respective language (ie: https://github.com/open-feature/node-sdk-contrib) or in other repositories not owned by the OpenFeature organization. We recommend implementations be open source, but that's not a requirement.

## Governance

Our goal is to join the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) as a sandbox project shortly after the inception of OpenFeature.
Should it be accepted, the project will establish governance following CNCF recommended practices. Until then, a temporary governance charter can be found [here](./governance-charter.md).

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
