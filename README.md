## Welcome to the OpenFeature community!

If you are interested to be informed about the project or to contribute, feel free to add yourself and/or your organization to [Interested Parties](./interested-parties.md).

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-feature/projects/1).
New initiatives for the roadmap will be marked as `roadmap-proposal` by a maintainer. A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).

### Contributing prerequisites (CLA/DCO)

## Governance

Our goal is to join the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) as a sandbox project shortly after the inception of OpenFeature.
Should it be accepted, the project will establish governance following CNCF recommended practices. Until then, a temporary governance charter can be found [here](./governance-charter.md).
